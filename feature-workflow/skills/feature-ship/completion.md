## Run Full Test Suite

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test 2>/dev/null || echo "No test command found"

# Run type check if available
npm run type-check 2>/dev/null || npm run typecheck 2>/dev/null || echo "No type-check"

# Run lint if available
npm run lint 2>/dev/null || echo "No lint command"
```

## Verify Build

```bash
# Verify build succeeds
npm run build 2>/dev/null || echo "No build command"
```

## Review Implementation Checklist

Check that all items in `docs/features/[id]/plan.md` are marked complete:
- Read the plan file
- Count checked `- [x]` vs unchecked `- [ ]` items
- If unchecked items remain, ask user:
  ```
  ## Incomplete Tasks Found

  The following tasks in plan.md are not marked complete:
  - [ ] [Task 1]
  - [ ] [Task 2]

  Options:
  1. Mark these as complete (if actually done)
  2. Remove from scope (if not needed)
  3. Cancel completion (finish tasks first)
  ```

## User Confirmation

```
## Final Verification Summary

Security Review: Passed
QA Validation: Passed
Tests: [N] passing
Build: Successful
Plan Tasks: [N/N] complete

Ready to mark feature as completed?

This will:
- Create shipped.md with completion notes
- Update DASHBOARD.md (move to Completed section)
- Feature files will remain in docs/features/[id]/ as a record

Proceed? (yes/no)
```

**Output**: Final verification complete, user confirmation received

# Phase 5: Write shipped.md (REQUIRED)

**You MUST write shipped.md BEFORE committing.** This file marks the feature as completed and triggers the status update.

Do not skip this step. Do not commit first.

## Write shipped.md

Write `docs/features/[id]/shipped.md` with the following format:

```markdown
---
shipped: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Shipped: [Feature Name]

## Summary
Brief summary of what was delivered...

## Key Changes
- Change 1
- Change 2
- Change 3

## Files Changed
- `path/to/file1.ts`
- `path/to/file2.ts`
- `path/to/file3.ts`

## Testing
- Tests: [N] passing
- Coverage: [X]% (if available)
- Manual testing completed

## Quality Gates Passed
- Security Review: Passed
- QA Validation: Passed
- Build: Successful

## Notes
Any follow-up items, known limitations, or context for future maintainers...
```

## Gathering Files Changed

Before writing shipped.md, collect the list of files changed for this feature. Run:

```bash
git diff --name-only $(git log --all --grep="[feature-id]" --format=%H | tail -1)^..HEAD -- . ':!docs/features/'
```

If that doesn't capture all changes, use the commit range from when `plan.md` was created to now:

```bash
git log --oneline docs/features/[id]/plan.md
# Use that commit hash as the start point
git diff --name-only <plan-commit>^..HEAD -- . ':!docs/features/'
```

Include all implementation files (source, tests, config) but exclude the feature's own docs directory (`docs/features/[id]/`).

**IMPORTANT**: Writing shipped.md automatically triggers the PostToolUse hook which regenerates DASHBOARD.md. You do NOT need to update DASHBOARD.md directly.

The hook automatically:
1. Detects the new shipped.md file
2. Regenerates DASHBOARD.md (feature moves to Completed section)

**Clear statusline** (after writing shipped.md):
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/feature-ship/scripts/clear-context.sh
```

## Stage and Commit

After writing shipped.md (and confirming the hook updated DASHBOARD.md):

```bash
git add docs/features/[id]/ docs/features/DASHBOARD.md
git commit -m "Ship: [feature-name]"
```

**Output**: Feature marked as completed, statusline cleared, changes committed
