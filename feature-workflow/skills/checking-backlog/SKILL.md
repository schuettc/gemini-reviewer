# Backlog Awareness

Automatically check the project backlog when the user discusses feature ideas, priorities, or planned work.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when the user:
- Proposes new functionality: "We should add...", "It would be nice if...", "What if we..."
- Asks about planned work: "What features are planned?", "Is X in the backlog?"
- Discusses priorities: "What should we work on next?", "What's most important?"
- Mentions a specific feature by name that might be tracked

## Instructions

### Step 1: Load Dashboard

Read `docs/features/DASHBOARD.md` to see all features by status.

If it doesn't exist: "No backlog found. Use `/feature-capture` to start tracking."

### Step 2: Search for Matches

Parse the DASHBOARD.md tables to find:
- Feature IDs and names in each section (In Progress, Backlog, Completed)
- Priority and effort information

For deeper context on a specific feature, read its files:
```
docs/features/[id]/
├── idea.md      # Problem statement, priority, effort, impact
├── plan.md      # Implementation details (if in-progress)
└── shipped.md   # Completion notes (if completed)
```

Search `idea.md` for:
- `name` in frontmatter (partial match, case-insensitive)
- Problem statement content (keyword match)
- `affectedAreas` (if user mentions specific areas)

### Step 3: Respond Based on Results

- **Feature exists**: Show status, priority, and category from DASHBOARD.md. Suggest `/feature-plan [id]` if in backlog.
- **Related items found**: List them with their category, ask if user's idea is an extension or new feature.
- **Not tracked**: Suggest `/feature-capture` to add it.

## Example

**User**: "We should add dark mode support"

**Response**:
```
This feature is already tracked:

**Dark Mode Toggle** (ID: dark-mode-toggle)
- Status: backlog
- Priority: P1

Ready to start! Use `/feature-plan dark-mode-toggle`
```

## Integration Notes

This skill works with:
- `/feature-capture` - Suggest when idea isn't tracked
- `/feature-plan` - Suggest when item is in backlog
- `/feature-status` - For broader status queries
