# Progress Tracker

Track feature implementation progress by updating plan.md when tasks are completed.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when the user:
- Completes a task: "Done with X", "Finished the Y"
- Makes a commit related to the feature
- Says they've implemented something
- Explicitly asks to update progress

## Important: Ask Before Writing

This skill modifies files. **Always ask before making changes.**

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify the Feature

Read `docs/features/DASHBOARD.md` and look at the **In Progress** section to find current features.

If multiple exist, check context or ask which one.

### Step 2: Load the Plan

Read `docs/features/[id]/plan.md`

Locate:
- **Progress Log** section (usually at the end)
- **Implementation Steps** section (checkbox list)

### Step 3: Prepare Update

From the user's statement, identify what was completed and match it to implementation steps.

Prepare:
1. Progress log entry with date and description
2. Checkbox update: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`

### Step 4: Confirm and Apply

Show proposed changes, get confirmation, then use Edit tool to apply.

## Example

**User**: "Done with the JWT token refresh logic"

**Response**:
```
Update progress in plan.md?

1. Add progress log entry:
   ### 2026-01-15
   - Completed JWT token refresh logic in auth/tokens.ts
   - Next: Implement session timeout handling

2. Mark complete:
   - [x] Implement JWT token refresh logic

Proceed? (yes/no)
```

**After confirmation**:
```
Progress updated in plan.md:
- Added log entry for 2026-01-15
- Marked complete: Implement JWT token refresh logic

Remaining steps: 4 of 7
```

## Error Handling

- **No plan.md**: "No implementation plan found. Run /feature-plan first."
- **No matching step**: "Couldn't find a matching step. Add to progress log only?"
- **Multiple matches**: List options and ask which to check off

## Integration Notes

This skill works with:
- `/feature-ship` - Relies on accurate progress tracking
