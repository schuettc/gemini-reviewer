# Phase 5: Verification

## Verify Fix Works

Confirm the fix resolves the original problem.

### Verification Methods

#### 1. Reproduction Test

```
## Verification: Reproduction Test

Please try to reproduce the original problem:

1. [Original step 1]
2. [Original step 2]
3. [Original step 3]

**Expected**: The problem should no longer occur.

Does the issue still happen?
```

#### 2. Automated Tests

Run relevant tests:

```bash
npm test              # Full suite
npm test -- [pattern] # Specific tests
```

#### 3. Targeted Testing

Create specific test for the fix:

```
## Targeted Verification

Testing specific scenario:
- Input: [test input]
- Expected: [expected result]
- Actual: [what happened]

Status: [PASS/FAIL]
```

## Check for Regressions

Ensure fix didn't break other things:

### 1. Run Full Test Suite

```bash
npm test
```

### 2. Check Related Functionality

```
## Regression Check

Testing related functionality that might be affected:

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| User login | Verified working |
| User registration | Verified working |
| Password reset | Verified working |
| Session management | Verified working |
```

### 3. Type/Lint Checks

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
```

3. **Rollback** - Undo changes and try different hypothesis

What would you like to do?
```

### If Regressions Found

```
## Regression Detected

The fix introduced a new issue:

### Regression
[Description of new problem]

### Test Failures
- [test1]: [reason]
- [test2]: [reason]

### Options

1. **Adjust fix** - Modify to avoid regression
2. **Rollback** - Undo and try different approach
3. **Accept trade-off** - If regression is acceptable (rare)

How should we proceed?
```

## Handle Partial Success

If fix partially works:

```
## Partial Resolution

The fix addressed part of the problem:

- [x] [Symptom 2] - Fixed

### Still Occurring
- [ ] [Symptom 3] - Still present

### Next Steps

This may be multiple issues. Options:
1. **Continue** - Investigate remaining symptoms
2. **Accept partial** - Mark main issue as resolved, create new issue for remainder
3. **Rollback** - This fix isn't the complete solution
```

**Output**: Fix verified working, resolution documented
